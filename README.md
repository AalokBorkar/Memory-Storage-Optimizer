# Storage Memory Optimizer
Software designed to intelligently maintain a set memory capacity for a device's file system by dynamically freeing data as it expands.

# Motivation
Throughout the past few months I have noticed my phone's performance drastically decrease as I download more files and data. As I came to this realization it occured to me that there is a huge portion of my device's memory being occupied by content and files that I havent touched in ages. With this in mind I was driven to create a software solution to allow the everyday user to endlessly download new content onto their devices without having to worry about their memory usage or subsequent performance decay.

# Practicality
To assess the real world functionality of Storage Memory Optimizer, I also developed a simulation (included in the software's main file) that simulates a person using the software for a music library (for *X* virtual days), including listening to and adding new randomly generated songs to their memory-capped library.

# Frameworks
Storage Memory Optimizer is written completely in vanilla C++14, with the following additional imported libraries: <vector>, <algorithm>, <time>.
  
# Running the Software (Linux/Windows/MacOS)

# Languages Used
*Application popup built using HTML, Javascript (JQuery, Mark.JS), & CSS3 *Background script build using Javascript (Chrome Messaging API, Chrome Tabs API)
